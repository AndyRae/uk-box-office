UK Box Office data is the most detailed and searchable source for box office data in the UK.

Through using the [BFI weekend box office reports](https://www.bfi.org.uk/education-research/film-industry-statistics-research/weekend-box-office-figures), we visualise box office back to September 2001, with new data every week on a Wednesday.

This is a tool ideal for film professionals, researchers, and students; to help create a more intelligent and open sector. Before this website, you had to dig through those spreadsheets or rely on box office mojo, which is in dollars.

It is not an exhaustive data set - the source only includes the weekly box office for the top 15 films, British films, and new releases. But this still covers 99%+ of the market. There are also inevitably some errors in the data, as there are over 10,000 films, 1,000 distributors, and 40,000 weekly records.

Thereâ€™s a lot of data here, and plenty of ways to visualise it - please do get in touch with me if you have an idea that could make the site better, or more useful for you.
